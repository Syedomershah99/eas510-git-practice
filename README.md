# My AI Learning Journey

This repository documents my journey in learning AI and technology. I am exploring various aspects of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and software development.

I'm currently a graduate student in ES (Artificial Intelligence) at University at Buffalo

I learn by shipping—and then tightening the feedback loop.

I started by freelancing full-stack sites, where delivery dates and Lighthouse scores taught me to measure what matters. That focus on impact carried into backend/ML work: authentication services that serve 10,000+ monthly requests, latency shaved ~30% through query optimization, and semantic search accelerated 2× with vector DBs.

From there I dove into applied AI. I fine-tuned LLMs (LLaMA3, Mistral) with RAG and memory chaining to lift answer relevance, and I integrated multiple VLMs into production systems to automate real workflows. In one HR SaaS context, an agentic pipeline combined OCR and lightweight models to drop resume-parsing latency by an order of magnitude. I’ve also pushed on edge/real-time: camera/RTSP pipelines, DeepStream analytics, and mobile inference for medical image triage—plus research-style projects like a rover vision stack that marries self-supervised features with YOLO fine-tuning.

Outside code, I organize, teach, and mentor—running workshops as an AWS Certified Instructor and leading a student cloud club that reached 1,200+ learners—because sharing the “why” behind the build helps me build better.
